## Oveview  
Squarebox is a search engine platform that utilizes AI agents to analyze and recommend relevant content based on user search queries. Unlike conventional search engines, Squarebox is specifically designed for the Web3 ecosystem, enabling users to search for blockchain-related data, NFTs, and token trends.  

Additionally, Squarebox collects and organizes frequently searched keywords, ranking them based on popularity and displaying real-time trending keywords on Twitter through automated AI agent bots. This allows users to gain insights into the most discussed topics within the Sonic ecosystem.  

By integrating various AI and blockchain technologies, Squarebox provides a unique approach to retrieving and visualizing Web3 data efficiently.  

## Problem Statement  
With the rapid expansion of Web3 and blockchain ecosystems, users struggle to find consolidated and relevant information. Searching for blockchain-related content often requires navigating multiple platforms such as OpenSea for NFTs, Etherscan for transaction details, and Twitter for community insights. This fragmented experience creates inefficiencies and slows down decision-making for traders, investors, and enthusiasts.  

## Solution  
Squarebox streamlines Web3 search by integrating AI-powered recommendations, blockchain data aggregation, and Twitter trend analysis. Our platform not only allows users to search for transaction data, NFTs, and tokens, but also provides:  
- **AI-driven keyword analysis**: Tracks the most popular search terms and trends in real-time.  
- **Automated Twitter engagement**: Uses AI bots to post trending topics, increasing visibility.  
- **Aggregated blockchain insights**: Provides transaction history, market listings, and NFT/token-related details from multiple sources.  
- **Real-time price predictions**: Powered by Allora, Squarebox offers decentralized inference-based price forecasts for searched tokens, assisting users in making informed trading decisions.  

By combining AI-driven analysis with blockchain transparency, Squarebox ensures that users get the most relevant and up-to-date information without navigating multiple platforms.
